Package: odtone
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Multi-Platform implementation of the IEEE 802.21 Protocol
 ODTONE stands for Open Dot Twenty ONE and it is an open-source implementation
 of the Media Independent Handover framework from the IEEE 802.21 Media
 Independent Handover Services standard, using C++ APIs.
 ODTONE supplies the implementation of a MIHF, supporting its inherent services
 (Media Independent Event Service (MIES), Media Independent Command Service
 (MIIS) and Media Independent Command Service (MICS), as well as supporting
 mechanisms (Capability Discovery, MIHF Registration, Event Registration, etc.).
 It also provides a set of APIs to enable ODTONE users to implement their own
 MIH-Users and Link SAPs and to interface with ODTONE's MIHF.
 This package includes several applications developed by the ODTONE project.
